Is ground white pepper safe to use after the ""expiration"" date on the package? Yes, provided  it is properly stored and the package is undamaged  —  commercially packaged ground white pepper will typically carry a ""Best By,"" ""Best if Used By,"" ""Best Before,"" or ""Best When Used By"" date but this is not a safety date, it is the manufacturer's estimate of how long the ground white pepper will remain at peak quality.
Does ground white pepper ever spoil? No, commercially packaged ground white pepper does not spoil, but it will start to lose potency over time and not flavor food as intended -  the storage time shown is for best quality only.
How can you tell if ground white pepper is still good? To test whether ground white pepper is still potent enough to be effective: Rub or crush a small amount in your hand, then taste and smell it - if the aroma is weak and the flavor is not obvious, the ground white pepper should be replaced. "
